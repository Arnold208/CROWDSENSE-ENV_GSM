RTC_DS1307_Custom Library Documentation
---------------------------------------

Class Overview:
The RTC_DS1307_Custom class provides an interface to manage the RTC_DS1307 real-time clock module. It extends basic functionality with robust error handling and additional features for setting and retrieving time in various formats, as well as synchronization with server time.

Public Methods:

1. Constructor: RTC_DS1307_Custom()
   - Description: Initializes a new instance of the RTC_DS1307_Custom class.
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: None

2. bool begin()
   - Description: Initializes the RTC module and checks if it is running. Sets the time to the compiled date and time if the RTC is not running.
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: true if the RTC is successfully initialized and running, false otherwise.

3. bool checkRunning()
   - Description: Checks if the RTC is currently running and sets the time if it is not.
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: true if the RTC is running, false if the RTC was not running and the time was set.

4. void setTime(DateTime dt)
   - Description: Sets the RTC to a specified date and time.
   - Parameters:
     - DateTime dt: The date and time to set the RTC to.
   - Returns: true if the time was successfully set, false otherwise.

5. DateTime now()
   - Description: Retrieves the current date and time from the RTC.
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: A DateTime object representing the current date and time.

6. time_t getEpochTime()
   - Description: Gets the current date and time as an epoch time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970).
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: The current time as a time_t (long integer) value.

7. String getFormattedTime()
   - Description: Returns the current date and time in the format "YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS".
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: A String representing the formatted current time.

8. bool correctTime(DateTime correctTime)
   - Description: Corrects the RTC's current time if it differs from a provided correct time.
   - Parameters:
     - DateTime correctTime: The correct date and time to set if there's a mismatch.
   - Returns: true if the time was corrected, false if no correction was needed.

9. bool syncTimeWithServer(DateTime serverTime)
   - Description: Synchronizes the RTC's time with a provided server time.
   - Parameters:
     - DateTime serverTime: The server-provided time to synchronize with.
   - Returns: true if the RTC time was updated, false if it was already in sync.

10. void setTimeToCompiled()
    - Description: Sets the RTC's time to the date and time when the sketch was compiled.
    - Parameters: None
    - Returns: None

11. void printTime()
    - Description: Prints the current time to the Serial output in a human-readable format.
    - Parameters: None
    - Returns: None

12. void printFutureTime(int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds)
    - Description: Prints a future time calculated from the current time plus a specified interval.
    - Parameters:
      - int days: Days to add to the current time.
      - int hours: Hours to add.
      - int minutes: Minutes to add.
      - int seconds: Seconds to add.
    - Returns: None

Example Usage:

#include <Arduino.h>
#include "RTC_DS1307.h"

RTC_DS1307_Custom rtc;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(57600);
    rtc.begin();
    rtc.setTimeToCompiled(); // Set RTC to compiled time
}

void loop() {
    rtc.printTime(); // Print current time every 10 seconds
    delay(10000);
}
